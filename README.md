# The Movie Database Asynchronous JavaScript Project

Asynchronous JavaScript is an important part of JS, so I was surprised that the Meta Front-End Developer certification didn't mention it.

I therefore needed a project to get some hands-on experience, and The Movie Database (TMDb) had the perfect API to achieve this.

## Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Asynchronous JavaScript
- TMDb API

## Project Overview

The project is a focused one with a simplistic interface. The user picks a genre from a dropdown menu, and the API picks a random movie from the genre selection. The user then has the option to either like or dislike the recommendation.

Overall, this was a very challenging, but necessary project for me to complete. With this being my first hands-on experience using asynchronous JavaScript, it took a lot of time, trial and error, research, and even running some of the code through AI to get working correctly.

The setbacks and frustrations were worth it in the end though. The project successfully uses the fetch API to call multiple get requests that create the aforementioned functionality. All done using ES8 async/await syntax.

I need more practice before I am fully confident in my asynchronous JavaScript skills, but this project gave me a solid foundation to build upon. I look forward to getting this experience and becoming an even better JavaScript developer.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/acktreptow/movie-recommender.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd movie-recommender`
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Future Enhancements

I would like to add another page that has the same functionality, but with TV shows instead, as this is also possible with TMDb. I would then use that page to practice other ways of writing asynchronous code via ES6 promises and/or even older techniques like callbacks so that I have an even better understanding of asynchronous JavaScript.
