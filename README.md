# The Movie Database Asynchronous JavaScript Project

Asynchronous JavaScript is an important part of the language, so I was surprised that the Meta Front-End Developer certification didn't even mention it. Perhaps Meta felt its concepts were too advanced for the course.

Regardless of the reasoning, I wanted to get some hands-on experience with Asynchronous JavaScript. And with my love for movies, The Movie Database (TMDb) had the perfect API to build a project around getting this experience.

## Technologies used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Asynchronous JavaScript
- TMDb API

## Project Overview

The project is a focused one with a simplistic interface. The user picks a genre from a dropdown menu, and the API picks a random movie from the genre selection. The user then has the option to either like or dislike the recommendation.

Overall, this was a very challenging, but necessary project for me to complete. Despite my knowledge on the subject matter, with this being my first project experience with TMDb's API and asynchronous JavaScript, it took a lot of time, trial and error, research and even running code through AI to get working correctly.

It was worth it in the end though. The project successfully uses the fetch API to call multiple get requests that create the aforementioned functionality. All done using ES8 async/await syntax.

I need more practice before I am fully confident in my asynchronous JavaScript skills, but this project gave me a solid foundation of the concepts to build upon. Which based off of Meta's syllabus for its Front End Dev certification, is perhaps more than most self-taught junior developers can say.

I look forward to getting this experience and becoming an even better JavaScript developer.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/acktreptow/tmdb-api.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd tmdb-api`
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Future Enhancements

I would like to add another page that has the same functionality, but with TV shows instead, as this is also possible with TMDb. I would then use that page to practice other ways of writing asynchronous code via ES6 promises and/or even older techniques like callbacks, instead of using async await, so that I have an even better understanding of asynchronous JavaScript.
